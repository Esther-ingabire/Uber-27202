| ---------------- | -------------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| fare_amount      | Float          | Trip fare in USD     | 0              |
| pickup_datetime  | Decimal number | Pickup timestamp     | 0              |
| pickup_longitude | Float          | Pickup longitude     | 0              |
| pickup_latitude  | Float          | Pickup latitude      | 0              |
| passenger_count  | Integer        | Number of passengers | 0              |

### 3.2 Data Preprocessing Pipeline

**Step 1: Data Cleaning**

- Removed unnecessary identifier columns (Unnamed: 0, key)
- Converted pickup_datetime to proper datetime format
- Handled missing values using median imputation for coordinates

**Step 2: Data Validation**

- Filtered fare amounts below $2.50 (minimum fare threshold)
- Applied geographical bounds for NYC area:
  - Longitude: -74.03 to -73.75
  - Latitude: 40.63 to 40.85
- Restricted passenger counts to reasonable range (1-6 passengers)

**Step 3: Feature Engineering**

- Extracted temporal features: pickup_hour, pickup_dayofweek
- Calculated trip distances using Haversine formula
- Removed trips shorter than 100 meters
- Applied outlier removal using Interquartile Range (IQR) method

**Step 4: Data Enhancement**

- Created passenger count categories
- Developed fare range classifications
- Generated distance-based trip segments

### 3.3 Statistical Summary

**Fare Analysis:**

- Mean: $11.36
- Median: $8.50
- Standard Deviation: $9.90
- Range: $2.50 - $499.00
- 25th Percentile: $6.00
- 75th Percentile: $12.50

**Distance Analysis:**

- Calculated using Haversine formula for accuracy
- Filtered trips > 0.1 km to remove data errors
- Applied IQR-based outlier removal

**Passenger Distribution:**

- 1 passenger: 138,425 rides (69.2%)
- 2 passengers: 29,428 rides (14.7%)
- 5 passengers: 14,009 rides (7.0%)
- 3 passengers: 8,881 rides (4.4%)
- 4 passengers: 4,276 rides (2.1%)
- 6 passengers: 4,271 rides (2.1%)

### 3.4 Temporal Patterns
